We want to share with you the joy of British motoring, but we\'ll also be here to support you through any kind of maintenance or repair your car may need.

We\'ve provided parts, service, repair and restoration to Colorado\'s sports car community since 1998, but we have over 100 years of combined experience on staff. We specialize in the service, repair and restoration of MG, Triumph, Austin-Healey, Jaguar, and Sunbeam cars from the 1940-70s. We also work on Classic Mini, Morris, and Rover cars among others, as well as some honorary British sports cars: Volvo 1800s and Datsun roadsters. The above picture was not staged-- we often find ourselves with an abundance of cars, in a variety of makes and models (for more see our <a href=\"http://www.sportscarcraftsmen.com/gallery.php?cat=2\" target=\"_blank\"> Line ups</a>).

As such, it was our honor to host the 10th annual BMTA conference in February 2012, which drew 42 companies from across the country to Denver for a weekend of seminars, tours, and talk. Centered on the theme of \"Revisiting the  Basics\", the conference surveyed the state of the British car industry, offering a series of seminars on the fundamentals of the business. The weekend culminated in an evening at Erico Motorsports, accompanied by a talk entitled \"Three Significant Cars\". Over the course of the weekend, people from all facets of the industry - suppliers, retailers and media - were able to communicate freely and collaborate on new ways to reach out to customers and to each other. By all accounts, the weekend was a resounding success and we were thrilled to host such a revitalizing conference. <p>\r\n\r\nWe have been featured in numerous national publications, including <a href=\"http://www.classicmotorsports.net\" target=\"blank\"> Classic Motorsports Magazine </a> (most recently March 2013, but also January 2007, September 2007, March 2008, September 2008, May 2009, March 2011 [twice], July 2011, <a href=\"http://classicmotorsports.net/articles/tech-tips-mini-cooper/\" target=\"_blank\"> November 2011 [three times]</a>, March 2012, July 2012), <a href=\"http://healey.org/content/view/252/182/\" target=\"blank\"> Austin-Healey Magazine</a> (October 2010, January 2011),<a href=\"http://www.namgbr.org/page/journal/\" target=\"blank\"> MGB Driver </a> (2009), and The Denver Post (October 7, 2010).<p><center><img src=\"art/title.jpg\"></center>\r\n\r\n',0,7,'Welcome to our shop!'),(10,'Map','http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=5635+Kendall+Court,+Arvada,+CO+80002&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=68.73358,95.976563&ie=UTF8&ll=39.80036,-105.066032&spn=0.008342,0.011716&z=16&iwloc=cent',12,17,'Punch your address in GoogleMaps and get directions to our shop.'),(11,'<img src=\"art/logo_bmta.gif\" border=0>','http://www.britcar.org/',14,49,''),(12,'Contact Us','contact.php',13,17,'Contact us via email or telephone'),(13,'Parts We Make','Repairing and restoring old cars requires the use of many replacement parts in the process.

While it\'s packed with interesting bits and bobs to keep even the most avid fans occupied for hours, it also represents an entirely different way of thinking.  We readily admit that our showroom isn’t considered ‘normal’. Instead, we hope to show you just what British cars can do. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We highlight some of the newest innovations in British motoring, such as the supercharged Bugeye Sprite and Triumph TR250. Sports Car Craftsmen, LLC was the first shop in the country to install and test drive the supercharged Bugeye Sprite, which dramatically increases the horsepower of these cars, making them into street-legal go-carts. Triumph’s TR3, TR4, TR250 and TR6 now have the option of supercharging as well, to make sure that fun is equally shared among all British car marques.<br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nissan 5 speed conversion is another upgrade we like to promote as a way to get the most from your MG. It’s important to have an overdriven top gear for prolonged highway driving, and this modern option is less expensive to install and easier to find than the factory original overdrive transmissions. With this upgrade, motoring in the beautiful Colorado mountains becomes easier and more enjoyable. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cosmetic department, we feature an MGB bumper conversion from rubber to chrome, a worthwhile undertaking for those who prefer the chrome bumpers on their later model MGBs. All of our showroom cars are available for a demonstration ride by appointment. At Sports Car Craftsmen we believe in showing you how fun your British car can be and will gladly answer any questions you may have. A restoration, whether partial or an entire renovation, a transmission conversion or engine rebuild can be a daunting proposition. We will walk you through the process, making it an easy and painless transition. And at the end of the journey, you should be happy with the increased performance and drivability of your new car. Many of us owned British cars as younger, and perhaps less sensible folks who believed that driving these cars was exciting, exotic, and adventurous. Today, you might recall your faded youth with a car that actually lives up to those expectations. And with your improved performance, it’s easier than ever to hook kids and grandkids, ensuring another generation of British car enthusiasts. <br></br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a large selection of literature covering the cost of paint jobs and engine rebuilds, as well as advice on worthwhile modern upgrades for your car and factory information about our supercharging kits.  We also showcase a vast collection of British sports car memorabilia, from posters to model cars and trophies. Every shop has its obligatory cache of cool stuff, and ours is second to none.  You can see pictures of some of our most exciting restorations and read up on the latest British sports car events happening around Colorado. \r\n','Paul Dierschow','P9120006.JPG',12,0,''),(740,45,'Our Main Work Area','Our new facility contains three main work areas, the largest of which accommodates three lifts as well as extra workspace for unit repairs and major restorations.

We hope that this trip is a memorable one for the attendees, albeit hopefully for the right reasons, not wrong ones.  Undoubtedly, we\'ll be called on to help coach people through the mechanical aspects of making the trip successfully, so here\'s some tips about what you might expect to encounter on your adventure.<br></br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that most people will notice about the time they arrive at the folksy Colorado border sign is a distinctly lower level of performance than they are accustomed to from their car.  This is a very common complaint; that\'s because it affects everyone unilaterally.  There\'s an easy explanation, and it\'s found under your hood.  If you open it and look, you\'ll find that . . . someone stole your compression!!!  Yep, while you were minding your own business during the mind-numbing drive across Nebraska, Kansas, or Texas, you wuz robbed.  Even though your eyes were open, your air density was decreased by a full 10%, and you may have even missed the posted warning signs entirely.  As if that wasn\'t bad enough, you\'ll find that the consequence of that invisible, meager 10% decrease in air pressure translates into a whopping 18% loss of horsepower.  So your perky MG with 135 psi compression at home can now only muster about 120 psi in Denver at 5300 feet.  And that\'s just at the base of the Big Hill.  Sixty miles further west, by the time you cross under the Continental Divide inside the Eisenhower tunnels on I-70, you\'ll exceed 11,000 feet. Ay, caramba!  Now we\'re talking only double digit compression, and horsepower that won\'t qualify as a moron!  If you don\'t believe it\'s important, just get out of your car at the tunnel parking lot and test it for yourself by running a short sprint. You\'ll have new sympathy for your car.  (Just kidding, DON\'T DO IT!  You\'ll be flattened. Now.)<br></br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what\'s the solution?  The easy answer is to replace your lost compression with that produced by a supercharger.  End of that problem.  However, the answer for the rest of us is basically, to live with it, with some minor adjustments.  The most important adjustment is to one\'s expectations.  Climbing the Big Hill requires patience and perhaps some strategizing, but you\'ll never get your performance back until you head back toward home.  As far as tuning for altitude, these are closely guarded secrets which have been passed down through incestuous generations of grizzled British car mechanics, akin to those of voodoo magic.  But now, for the first time ever, under threat of excommunication from Brotherhood of Keepers of Anachronistic Transport Contraptions, I will reveal the secret.  Here\'s the magic formula, never before seen in print . . . . LEAN OUT THE MIXTURE!  That\'s it.  That\'s all there is.<br></br>\r\n<i> Continued on the next page...</i>','Timothy Winkel','scan00011.jpg',0,1,'Would you like to take your British car to this altitude? Find out how!'),(916,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of a let down, huh?  The principle involved is this: as you drive higher, your fuel supply through the carb remains the same, even though the air component of the mixture keeps getting less and less.  This results in a mixture that continues to get richer as the air gets thinner, and before you know it you\'ve got some serious drivability problems.  Like smoking that rivals anything Detroit Diesel can produce.  The fix is to simply reduce the amount of fuel to return the air/fuel mixture to normal.  With a typical SU installation, the adjustment is simple: we plan on about a two flat adjustment of the jet adjusting nuts to make the mixture right for Denver; prorate for going higher.  That translates to 10 flats down from having the jet flush with the bridge, instead of 12 at sea level.  While the final tuning must always be done on the exhaust gas analyzer, this rule of thumb is good enough to get a car running from scratch.  We are frequently asked about the use of lean metering needles in our area, and we find that they are not necessary IF (hugely important if) the jets are in good condition.  With SU carbs, we do not consider using a lean needle unless a customer drives their car mostly above 8000 feet.  Stromberg cars are another story; we usually prefer lean needles, but mainly for the purposes of passing emissions testing.  Weber conversions require jet changes - that\'s a whole different article.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<i> Continued on the next page...</i>','Paul Dierschow','PB061161.JPG',1,1,'Page 2'),(917,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further adjustment that can be made, perhaps for the skeptics who might believe there\'s got to be more to it than just a simple mixture adjustment (trust me, you\'re not going to get your performance back...).  A small consolation prize can be won by advancing the timing just a little bit; 2 or 3 degrees is about it.  The principle involved here is that engines produce more power the more advanced the timing is, but too much advance will be harmful, as the engine will detonate (ping), and that burns holes in piston crowns (rarely considered desirable).  However, with your compression having been involuntarily lowered, you can advance the timing a little bit without incurring detonation, and therefore produce marginally more power.  I almost hate to mention this, as timing advance should be regarded as a loaded weapon, and handled in an educated and measured fashion.  If a little advance is good, more is not necessarily better!  <br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole tuning for altitude discussion is really greatly overshadowed by a much larger issue; one that we have to deal with nearly every day in the shop.  That is that carb adjustments are often the least of a car\'s woes.  More often than not, drivability complaints are explained by problems other than carb issues, instead they are almost always ignition related.  When a customer brings in a car complaining of carb problems, the first place we look is at the ignition system.  That\'s because the symptoms involved are often misleading; carb and ignition problems can manifest themselves similarly.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that 90% of \"carb\" problems are found under the distributor cap.  If someone complains that the carbs won\'t hold their tune for more than a week, the problem is most likely not carburettor related.  The bottom line is don\'t touch the carbs until the entire ignition system is proven to be good.  And the best tuning won\'t do much good if the basic condition of the engine is not sound.  You must start with good basics first.<br></br>\r\n<i> Continued on the next page...</i>','','PB061160.JPG',2,1,'Page 3'),(918,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here\'s some tips to increase your odds of making a successful trip:<br></br>\r\n• Check out your car thoroughly before you leave - do not wing it and hope for the best (this actually does happen).  Book your appointment now with your local LBC shop to be sure your car is up for the journey.<br></br>\r\n• Avoid using fuel containing ethanol, especially in high temperatures.  Our lower atmospheric pressure causes the fuel to vaporize easier, which induces vapor lock. The higher you go, the worse it gets.<br></br>\r\n• Pressure test your cooling system, as the ability to maintain high pressures is the key to not overheating.  Water boils at much lower temperatures out here: 202 at Denver, 192 at 11,000 feet.  Also, remember that running hot (good) does not equate to overheating (bad).<br></br>\r\n• If you encounter drivability problems along the way, don\'t start by fooling with the carbs - most likely it\'s explained by something else.<br></br>\r\n• If something untoward does happen, don\'t fret - you\'ve got the world\'s best classic car support system at your disposal.  You\'ve got highly qualified technicians available at the other end of the phone and you\'ve got whatever part you might possibly need only a day away, thanks to the wonders of air freight, and suppliers who really do care about the well being of their customers.  You\'re also in the company of a great crowd of caring enthusiasts with similar interests who never fail to amaze me with their stories of generosity and support for their comrades.<br></br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you the very best of luck on your journey.

','The original MGB gearbox was created for the small winding roads of the British countryside, not the long, straight highways of the American West. Whether your car is a daily driver or a weekend road tripper, it could undoubtably use a boost when it comes to mountain motoring. Authenticity is all well and good, and it’s always nice to see a classic British car complete with original parts, but for people who actually like to drive their cars, we’re huge fans of the Nissan 5 speed transmission conversion. This conversion corrects the lack of an overdriven top gear on most original MGs. <p>\r\nThe Nissan 5 speed conversion allows you to drive at highway speeds with lower revs than possible with a standard transmission.  The original MG engine was not built to sustain speeds of 75 miles per hour for extended periods of time. Without the conversion, the longer stroke and  higher revs need to sustain such a speed will wear on the engine over years of use. Overdriven top gears, whether provided by an original unit or a new Nissan unit, allow the engine to operate at lower revs, saving it from unnecessary wear and tear. Now an autumn jaunt in the mountains, a summer road trip out west, or even an afternoon picnic in the park becomes a more enjoyable experience all around.

With the engine off, push and release the clutch pedal.  Then, with a pry bar pushing between the crankshaft damper and the nearby crossmember, push the crankshaft backward in the block.  The backward movement should ideally be .004 to .008 inch; barely noticeable.  Upwards of .030 inch is common, but savable with immediate attention.  .125 inch indicates that the engine is a goner, most likely fatally damaging both crank and block.  $$$$$\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n2.  Look under the car sideways from the front edge of the driver\'s door and notice the angle of the clutch release arm sticking downward from the left side of the bellhousing.  If the arm points straight down, all is well; if it points back from vertical, the bolt that holds the clutch release bearing fork to the cross-shaft has sheared, requiring a transmission removal for repair.  $$$\r\n\r\n','','P2010064.JPG',0,1,''),(1093,101,'Tips 3 & 4','<br></br>\r\n3.  With the engine running and foot very firmly on the brake, slowly release the clutch while not allowing the car to move.  Then shift into reverse and repeat.  You are listening for a sharp clunk from the differential which reveals that the right front differential mount stud has broken loose from its woefully under-designed frame attachment.  All cars will need this repair at one time or another and requires differential removal for a proper repair.  $$\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n4.  With the hood open, look straight downward at each side of the front of the engine and observe the steel box welded to the frame where the lower control arms mount.  The box should be perfectly square and solid to the frame, and are frequently injured, particularly at the right rear mounting.  Look at the number of shims behind each control arm bracket: more than 5 or less than 1 on any one of the four insists on further examination.  $$\r\n\r\n','','P5261363.JPG',1,1,''),(1094,101,'Tips 5 & 6','<br></br>\r\n5.  Look at the chassis member on which each rear control arm mounts.  These are very frequently rusted out and may be indicators of more insidious chassis rust.  $$$\r\n<br></br>\r\n6. Grab the top of the rear tires and try to vigorously shake the wheel sideways.  Clunking here may indicate loose wheel bearings which could reveal severely worn rear axle parts. $$\r\n<br></br>\r\n','','PA310041.JPG',2,1,''),(1095,101,'Tips 7 & 8','7.  Look carefully at the seams between the body panels.  The four fenders should join their related scuttle, tonneau and front and rear panels with a clean, seamsealed groove.   The fenders should join the rocker panels below the chrome strip in a perfectly flush fashion, with the rear fender attached to the rocker with a small dot of brazing to enforce that flushness.  The joint lines frequently disappear with shoddy rust repair methods.  $$$$-???\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n8.  From the front of the car, sight down the gap between the hood and fender, and continue sighting that line down the top of the door and down the rear fender joint.  This line should reveal a gentle, consistent bulge in the middle with each side being a perfect mirror image of the other.  A lack of uniformity reveals some sort of serious incident in the car\'s past, which also demands further investigation.  Inspect the upper fender swage line.  The width should be uniform down the entire length of the car, tapering to zero at the end of each fender.  Lack of uniformity only belies bad bodywork, but it may be an indicator of what lies underneath.  $$-???\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n','','PA310043.JPG',3,1,''),(1096,101,'Tips 9 & 10','9.  Inspect the corners of the fenders; TR6 have numerous build in rust traps that, if revealed on the outer panels, most likely indicate similar damage to the related inner panels.  Look in the pockets above and around the headlamps and below the chrome line at the rear of the front fenders.  The rear fenders are particularly vulnerable above the tail lamps and along the edges at the top and front of those panels.  $$-??\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n10.  With the car on the ground, notice the gaps at the front and back of the doors relative to the adjacent fenders.  The front gap should have a consistent width; the rear almost never does with an original frame.  If that rear gap is twice as wide at the top as the bottom, it\'s normal and only visual annoying.  If the top gap is triple the lower width, the car\'s mileage is most likely well into six digits, regardless of what the odometer says.  $$-??\r\n<br></br>\r\n','','P5290175.JPG',4,1,''),(1097,101,'','Now that you are the proud new owner of a TR6, it’s time to actually drive the thing.  Realizing that driving our LBCs is a highly tactile experience, we like to pay close attention to small details of car repair that contribute to the sensory inputs experienced by the driver.  Some of these are major (i.e. switchgear operation, instrumentation, heater and door mechanisms). Others are much more subtle (ripples on the top of the hood, windshields with optical distortion, loose or rattling mirrors).\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nHere are three things we frequently deal with on TR6s that offer a very good return on investment toward making them far more enjoyable to drive.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n1.  Fix the looseness in the accelerator linkage.  Replacing the bushings which mount the pedal cross-shaft in the firewall and replacing the worn bolt and pivoting plate between the carbs will eliminate the lost motion in the system, which contributes greatly to the driver\'s perception of throttle precision.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n2.  Fix the looseness in the steering system.  These cars are notorious for allowing the entire rack and pinion to shift side-to-side in its mounting brackets on the frame.  Although new U-bolts and polyurethane bushings are a great improvement, simply spreading the brackets per the factory manual will usually do it.  Also, the little shelf just inside the firewall on which the upper steering column mounts is frequently broken at its corners.  A very minor welding job will work wonders to firm up the steering.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n3.  Replace the driver\'s seat diaphragm to solve that sinking feeling.  We know where old yellow pages go in retirement, but this is a far better, inexpensive solution.  Sitting back in the proper driving position can give one a whole new outlook on life.\r\n','','P5261361.JPG',5,1,''),(1098,19,'','','','P1060151.JPG',31,0,''),(1099,19,'','','','P5070189.JPG',32,0,''),(1100,103,'','','','P6280264.JPG',0,1,''),(1101,103,'','','','P6280265.JPG',1,1,''),(1102,103,'','','','P6280266.JPG',2,1,''),(1103,103,'','','','P6280268.JPG',3,1,''),(1104,103,'','','','P6280269.JPG',4,1,''),(1105,103,'','','','P6280270.jpg',5,1,''),(1106,103,'','','','P6280273.JPG',6,1,''),(1107,104,'','','','P7250060.JPG',0,1,''),(1108,104,'','','','P7250057.JPG',1,1,''),(1109,104,'','','','P7250062.JPG',2,1,''),(1110,104,'','','','P7250064.JPG',3,1,''),(1111,104,'','','','P7250065.JPG',4,1,''),(1231,77,'','','','P4021499.JPG',0,0,''),(1112,45,'TVR Grantura','This is the restored chassis of a TVR Grantura Series III, built in 1963.

While it\'s packed with interesting bits and bobs to keep even the most avid fans occupied for hours, it also represents an entirely different way of thinking. We readily admit that our showroom isn’t considered ‘normal’. Instead, we hope to show you just what British cars can do. <br></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We highlight some of the newest innovations in British motoring, such as the supercharged Bugeye Sprite and Triumph TR250. Sports Car Craftsmen, LLC was the first shop in the country to install and test drive the supercharged Bugeye Sprite, which dramatically increases the horsepower of these cars, making them into street-legal go-carts. Triumph’s TR3, TR4, TR250 and TR6 now have the option of supercharging as well, to make sure that fun is equally shared among all British car marques.<br></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nissan 5 speed conversion is another upgrade we like to promote as a way to get the most from your MG. It’s important to have an overdriven top gear for prolonged highway driving, and this modern option is less expensive to install and easier to find than the factory original overdrive transmissions. With this upgrade, motoring in the beautiful Colorado mountains becomes easier and more enjoyable. <br></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cosmetic department, we feature an MGB bumper conversion from rubber to chrome, a worthwhile undertaking for those who prefer the chrome bumpers on their later model MGBs. All of our showroom cars are available for a demonstration ride by appointment. At Sports Car Craftsmen we believe in showing you how fun your British car can be and will gladly answer any questions you may have. A restoration, whether partial or an entire renovation, a transmission conversion or engine rebuild can be a daunting proposition. We will walk you through the process, making it an easy and painless transition. And at the end of the journey, you should be happy with the increased performance and drivability of your new car. Many of us owned British cars as younger, and perhaps less sensible folks who believed that driving these cars was exciting, exotic, and adventurous. Today, you might recall your faded youth with a car that actually lives up to those expectations. And with your improved performance, it’s easier than ever to hook kids and grandkids, ensuring another generation of British car enthusiasts. <br></br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a large selection of literature covering the cost of paint jobs and engine rebuilds, as well as advice on worthwhile modern upgrades for your car and factory information about our supercharging kits. We also showcase a vast collection of British sports car memorabilia, from posters to model cars and trophies. Every shop has its obligatory cache of cool stuff, and ours is second to none. You can see pictures of some of our most exciting restorations and read up on the latest British sports car events happening around Colorado.

However, by comparing over 20 grilles produced between ‘62 and ’69, we discovered that this was not the case. Instead, there are several, often minute, differences within one particular version. And these changes were so small that they were not recorded in the official factory parts manual released by the company. \r\n','','P8122184.JPG',2,1,''),(1323,164,'','The most obvious of differences can be found in the grille teeth. On the earliest MGBs, produced between 1962 and October 1964, the teeth were made of individual stainless steel slats, which were then riveted to the two horizontal bars, which ran the width of the grille, connecting them to the outer rim structure. The upper bar is the same bar used in the later version, without the rivet holes, while the lower bar is unique to the earlier grille.  ','','P8122183.JPG',3,1,''),(1324,164,'','By the end of 1964, MG replaced the individual stainless steel teeth with a one piece anodized aluminum stamping. This method of production was undoubtedly much more cost effective, as the entire inner grille was riveted to the outer shell in one go, rather than tooth by tooth. Another consequence of this change (undoubtedly unintended but remarkably useful for our purposes), was that manufacturers opted to reproduce the 2nd iteration of the grille—forgoing the more labor intensive original. As a result, separating the earliest version of the MGB grille from later reproductions is relatively easy. Those grilles that are individually riveted are factory originals, while those that are not individually riveted need further inspection to determine their origins. \r\n \r\n','','P8122181.JPG',4,1,''),(1325,164,'','To do so, it is necessary to examine the individual teeth. The grilles manufactured by MG were produced to a much higher standard than those produced after market.  In almost every aspect, the MG grilles were more precisely stamped.  One of the biggest indications of a grille’s origins can be found in the shape of the V made by the teeth on the inward facing side of the grille. ','','P8122194.JPG',5,1,''),(1326,164,'','On original grilles, the V created by the teeth is generally equal sized—the legs of the V are equal in length.

To date, we have never found a badge with these studs intact, so it appears that this version of the badge was in production for a very short amount of time.

When the driver\'s rear end is located mere inches above the pavement and one looks eyeball-to-eyeball with an adjacent semi\'s lugnuts, it doesn\'t take extraordinary performance to make one of these cars feel like a street-legal go-kart.  I\'m fond of explaining it this way: you don\'t drive a Midget so much as you wear a Midget.  Although few drivers would rate the cockpit as luxurious, the overall experience of driving a well-sorted Midget is hard to beat despite the spartan appointments.  It\'s really all about enjoying the above-mentioned fun quotient above all else.<p>\r\nMany people also find ownership of these cars enjoyable because of the simple technology that nearly anyone can understand and work on themselves.  Being so basic, these cars are easy to modify and some projects can result in dramatic improvements from the original performance specifications.  Unfortunately, some well-intentioned \"improvements\" can lead to problematic results.  Here are a few examples from an exceedingly long list of common mistakes that might help you avoid making a Spridget mechanical blunder:<p>\r\n- <b>Don\'t</b> change the car from steel to wire wheels without changing the entire rear axle housing.  The wire wheel axles are nearly an inch shorter and, although they will move the car if installed in a steel wheel axle housing, the amount of axle spline engaging the differential side gear will be next to nothing.  We have encountered this problem several times when repairing cars in the shop.<p>\r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> use axles from a 948 or 1098 engined car if you have any performance ambitions whatsoever.  They are made from material that is quite inferior to that used for 1275 or 1500 powered cars.  Guaranteed to let you down when you least need or expect it.<p>\r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> spin the rear wheels of the car when driving the car from an unpaved area onto a hard road.  The shock generated by the abrupt change of traction is almost guaranteed to snap the right rear axle shaft effortlessly.  Again, severe disappointment may ensue.<p>\r\n-<b> Don’t</b> change the front brakes of a drum brake car to disc brakes without finishing the job. Make sure you change the rear brakes and the master cylinder to those from a disc brake car as well.   The front to rear brake bias will be changed to be far less than ideal if only the front brakes are changed.<p>  \r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> plan to put a 1098cc engine onto a smooth-case transmission that was behind a 948.  The 1098 clutch won\'t fit inside the bellhousing without very extensive modifications.<p>\r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> try to solve a clutch release problem by lengthening the slave cylinder pushrod.  The release bearing fork will hit the back of the opening of the bellhousing and bend it easily due to the force generated by the hydraulic pressure within the system.  Instead of making the problem worse, fix the original problem, which is usually a worn out release bearing or master cylinder pushrod.<p>\r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> fill the radiator in a cross-flow car through the pressure cap on the surge tank.  That will only partially fill the coolant system and hot running will quickly result.<p>\r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> choose the wrong alloy wheel to upgrade. Wheels have two measurements - their diameter and the width of the rim. While it’s easy to choose a wheel with the correct diameter, it is much more difficult to select an alloy wheel with the correct rim width. A wheel with an incorrect rim width will change how the wheel sits within the wheel well.  A wheel with too much positive offset will cause the tire to foul the rear wheel arch; too much negative offset will foul the leaf springs.  Your choices are limited.<p>\r\n-<b> Don\'t</b> buy a generic fuel pump just because it\'s cheap.  Most will produce far too much fuel pressure which will result in the carb float needles being overwhelmed and then initiate serious driveability problems.  Attempting to resolve this with a pressure regulator frequently produces further problems of leaking or inaccurate settings.

As with any complex system, breaking down a car to its component parts allows us to make sense of a large volume of information while covering all aspects of its drivability issues. This graphic is a road map to our system — a visual representation of the way we approach every car we revive from hibernation. \r\n<p> <p>\r\nThere are two major branches of getting a car up and running—mechanical and cosmetic. The cosmetic issues can be split into those which are structural, such as rust or accident damage; and visual, which covers paint, upholstery and trim. <p>\r\nThe mechanical issues, however, are more diverse and run deeper. First, we must discover the original point of failure on the car which caused the car to be parked in the first place. Sometimes this is an obvious issue, like a front-end collision.  Other times, the issue can be quite buried, stemming from an electrical or mechanical failure. Once we discover the original malfunction, we need to address the myriad issues stemming from the subsequent years of disuse. After sitting in a field for a year, ten, or thirty, any systems which rely on liquids—fuel, cooling, hydraulics and lubricants— will have degraded, possibly causing damage to the car at the same time. The electrical systems also need to be tested, to find any inoperative systems or those which have corroded due to age. <p>\r\n	By now, we’ve probably created a list of observations and concerns a mile long. This list will cover every aspect of the car in question. Not every item on the list needs to be addressed immediately, but it does raise another important question: how far do you want to take your project? Do you want to get the car running well enough to get it through emissions while still needing the occasional jump on cold mornings, or do you want to turn it into a reliable daily driver? Or would you like to completely <a href=” http://www.sportscarcraftsmen.com/gallery.php?cat=6\" target=\"_blank\"> restore it,</a> making it into a Conclave award-winner?

The most common fix is to “box in” the mounting bracket, reinforcing and stabilizing the bracket and stud, while spreading the load of constant pulling across a wider area, rather than a single small connection. This photo shows the \"boxing in\" technique used to reinforce the front differential mounts. The steel plate which creates the box stabilizes the mount by attaching it to the cross member in multiple planes, rather than a few flimsy welds to the front and rear lips of the cross member alone.

Both are susceptible to rust, though the bottom panel seems always the hardest hit. Replacing the entire panel prevents further damage to the frame and provides integral support to the entire frame.

Along the top and bottom edges of the floor, it is gently sloped up to where it meets the sides of the trunk.  Creating such a complex die, however, is a relatively expensive undertaking.

Harrington Ltd specialized in designing coach bodies throughout the early 20th century. In the 1960s, they expanded operations to include fiberglass hardtop conversions for Sunbeam and Triumph.  Sunbeam didn’t offer a GT version of the early Alpine, but in Britain it wasn’t uncommon for other companies to modify models post-production. This was the case with the Harrington. The Harrington Alpine, the first iteration of the series, took a Series II Alpine, modified the rear section, and added a fiberglass hardtop. This hardtop was accompanied by a new rear bulkhead and boot lid, making it a true conversion, not simply an accessory. Approximately 110 of these custom made Harrington Alpines were produced between late 1960 and 1961.','','harringtonalpine.jpg',0,1,''),(1515,182,'','In June 1961, the Harrington Alpine raced at Le Mans and surprisingly won the Index of Thermal Efficiency Award. In honor of this achievement, Harrington’s next Alpine model, introduced in October 1961, was named the Harrington Le Mans.  This version, still using the Alpine Series II body, was a visual departure from the earlier conversion. It removed the distinctive fins from the rear of the Alpine body and added vents in the rear quarter light windows. These ‘gills’ greatly change the overall look of the Harrington. Riding high on the success at Le Mans, 250 Harrington Le Mans were projected to be built, though most sources agree that such a target was never hit. Of those 250 projected, half were slated for export to the US. Unlike the earlier Harrington Alpine, the American version of the Le Mans was standard made, and came complete with overdrive. ','','P1181579.JPG',1,1,''),(1516,182,'','In October 1962, Harrington also introduced the “C” series, at the same time that the Harrington Le Mans was in production. Only about 20 of these cars, with restored fins of the Alpine Series II and a more refined back end, were produced.  <p>\r\nIn January 1963, the new Alpine Series 3 was introduced with several new features and improvements, including a split gas tank, taller fins, and a redesigned trunk. These changes meant that the fiberglass conversion used by Harrington needed to be redesigned to fit the new Alpine body. The top also fit the Alpine Series IV, so the conversion for both chassis are called “D” series. Approximately 6 conversions were produced for each chassis This low production of the later Harrington series may be due to Alpine’s introduction of a GT model with the Series 3, which was continued into Series IV. Simultaneously, Harrington Ltd was taken over by Robins & Day (owned by Rootes), which changed the focus of the company. While in the early days of the takeover, the tops were still produced by Harrington, Robins & Day eventually took control of manufacturing. As a result of the change of hands, Series 3 Alpine conversions were produced by Harrington while Series IV Alpine conversions were produced by Robins & Day. In late 1964, Robins & Day ceased production of the Harrington conversion, and by 1966, Harrington Ltd was shut down for good. \r\n','','P1181586.JPG',2,1,''),(1517,182,'','It’s estimated that Harrington produced approximately 384 Alpine conversions over 5 years of production.

Advertisements for $499 paint jobs may seem like an appealing, cost-efficient way to freshen up a car that’s 40 years old and in need of some TLC, but such a cheap job will yield a disappointing result. A well-done paint job can give a car a new lease on life, but there are several factors beyond the actual paint job which contribute to the overall cost of the job. <p>\r\nTo create a paint job that lasts, the foundations of the car must be sound. This means thoroughly tackling rust damage, correcting any improper previous repairs, and fixing any collision damage. After damage is repaired as needed, the body must be stripped of all trim parts (no over-reliance on painter’s tape here!). The body is then sanded or media blasted before being repainted. Once finished, the car is reassembled with the chrome, rubber, fasteners, and associated hardware. \r\n<p>\r\nObviously, a paint job is much more than just applying paint to the car. The cost of a complete, competent paint job can be significant. But \"quick and dirty\" paint jobs that don’t address and correct the underlying problems are merely short term patches that always disappoint.   As with most things in life, you generally get what you pay for.  A paint job done correctly the first time will give you satisfaction for years to come.

Clearly, Congress was dubious about MG’s “Safety Fast!” motto. As a result of the new legislation, MG had to completely redesign the MGB\'s bumpers. The first half of 1974 saw the introduction of a blocky rubber overrider, but in the latter half of the year the classic chrome bumper was replaced with an entirely rubber bumper. Converting to a rubber bumper  necessitated structural changes which allowed MG to reconfigure the engine bay at the same time. Never before had so much style been sacrificed in the name of safety.  \r\n<p>\r\nToday, chrome bumper conversions are a common request from owners who\'d like to return to the classic MGB style. Naturally, converting a post \'74 car back to the original chrome bumper requires more than a spare bumper, some extra bolts, and a empty afternoon. Our conversion modifies the car the way the factory would have done it, rather than being a cosmetic bolt-on. We modify the front fender, allowing us to replace the turn lamps and lower valence properly using the correct brackets for chrome bumpers. We also cut back the extended frame rail to house the early grille and valence.  For the rear bumper we correct the rear quarters to accommodate the chrome replacement. Then we make a custom bracket which allows us to use the rest of the original chrome bracketry, but which bolts on to the later car body without extensive renovation.

It is in remarkably good unrestored condition with a strong frame and straight body panels. \r\n<p>\r\nMG introduced the MGA Twin Cam in 1958 as a more powerful edition of the ground-breaking MGA (introduced in 1955). The Twin Cam boasted a 108 hp engine, which was a dramatic increase from the standard 72 hp MGA engine. It also sported disc brakes on all four wheels -  the first production car in the world to do so. Over the course of its two year run, however,  it was constantly beset by engine problems. Early versions of the car suffered constant oil leaks, fouled spark plugs and the occasional fractured engine. MG addressed all of those issues throughout the run of model, but the Twin Cam never truly recovered from the bad press garnered by the poor performance of original run.\r\n<p>\r\nOur Twin Cam is a later version of the car, and thus avoids all the problems of the early engines.

To date, the honor roll of alumni is well past 3000 cars, many of which I would like to have back.  But as they say, hindsight is always 20-20, and one must remember that business decisions are always determined by the economics of the time.  What\'s past is past.\r\n<br></br>\r\nRecently, it was time to face dealing with an seriously ailing \'66 MGB roadster.  It was one of those difficult end of life decisions.  Yes, it could have kept on going with all the right treatments and circumstances, but honestly, there was no quality of life left whatsoever, so it was time to let go and harvest the organs.  A portion of the left rear quarter went immediately--before the body was even cold--to help finish a wonderful \'67 GT that is currently being painted as we speak.  It was the last piece needed to make the renovation of this one-owner car complete, and thus allowed another car to survive gloriously into its second half-century.  The steel wheel suspension allowed an aspiring racer to rid itself of its infernal wire wheels.  The scuttle will help complete another steel dash retrofit into an unfortunately built pillow dash model.  All are noble causes now advanced by another\'s selfless sacrifice.\r\n<br></br>\r\nRegrettably, what finally did the \'66 in, of course, was all-to-common terminal cancer.  As with so many of these cases, there had been previous occurrences, but remission was only a temporary reprieve, as we\'ve seen so many times before.  The respite was undoubtedly appreciated, as it allowed a few more years of somewhat compromised enjoyment, but everyone likely knew in unspoken agreement that the inevitable would come, probably sooner than later.  Surely, things had deteriorated to a state of only existing, but not <i>living</i>.\r\n<br></br>\r\nPart of the previous treatment included dealing with the floors, which had been severely compromised by some risky lifestyle choices in its past.  I\'m sure we\'ve all seen this many times, but the normal solution is to \"patch\" the dying panel with whatever is lying around handy.  Traffic signs seem to be the favorite by far, probably due to their ubiquity, sturdy gauge, and inexpensive means of acquisition, but lesser quality repairs have included plywood sheets, new floorpans laid on top of the original, old license plates, or simply glued down indoor-outdoor carpet.  The solution used in the subject \'66 was amazing beyond all previous cases: poured concrete!  Nicely floated and troweled to a smooth surface, although not quite leveled, which resulted in somewhat of a tilt, with about 2\" thickness in the front, down to 1\" in the rear.  Unfortunately, this technique rendered the seat bottoms unsalvageable (not to mention unadjustable), as they were cast right in to the floor mass, along with everything else that was in the way.\r\n<br></br>\r\nAt first, this novel approach might sound crude, or at least unrefined, but upon further consideration it now seems to be nothing short of brilliant.  Think of the benefits: unexcelled sound deadening and vibration damping; unbeatable washability and wear resistance; and an impressive lowering of the CG.  Probably the biggest benefit would be that it provides the solution to the problem that American MG owners would appreciate the most: finally, adequate heat insulation from the under-seat muffler found on most of our cars.

As we’ve discussed  <a href =\"http://www.sportscarcraftsmen.com/gallery.php?proj=93\" target\"_blank\">elsewhere </a>, getting a paint job done properly requires many hours of labor — disassembling, repairing, sanding, painting, and reassembling all components on the car. Yet such attention to detail produces an outstanding result which will last for years to come. <p>\r\nHaving the right foundation sets up a car for a proper paint job, but there is another aspect to the venture that needs to be addressed before the project is completed: the color. The classic British sports car is a product of its time. This results in odd quirks (like a windscreen with 3 wipers on the American market), and certain technical limitations (have you ever tried driving your car up steep mountain passes?). But cars from this era also lend themselves to certain aesthetics and color schemes. An MGB looks fantastic in Carmine red, but in a modern Mustang red it looks garish — a bit like a toddler trying on mom’s makeup.  Being able to select a color that is sympathetic and complementary to your MGB’s appearance is not incredibly difficult, but it does require a bit of background knowledge. <p>\r\nBetween 1963 and 1980, MGBs sported 44 different colors in the American market 4 of which were offered for GTs exclusively. These colors were not offered simultaneously, but in waves lasting anywhere from one year to seven. Finding the perfect color for your car, then, is made easier knowing more about this wide range of original colors. \r\nIn true Sports Car Craftsmen style, we\'ve become a bit obsessed with documenting these color changes. At the shop, we currently have 34 original color samples displayed in our showroom. \r\n<p> We’ve also collated our information into an easy to read graph, organized by year and color. What you see in the graph below is as true as possible to the original color (but which may be some what distorted by your monitor\'s settings).  Putting these colors into such a chart reveals an interesting pattern — the colors can be (roughly) divided into three different palettes: Pastel (1963-69), Earth Tones (1970-76) and Crayola (1976-80). While there were other colors available in the British and overseas markets, the US market primarily used these colors. <p>\r\nNotably missing from these palettes are the shiny, metallic colors so prevalent on modern cars. MG did make 3 metallic shades (Bronze Metallic, Gold Beige Metallic, and Pewter Metallic), but these colors were only available for a single year, and remain rare as they were not offered in the US market.<p> \r\nKnowing the appropriate colors allows you to choose a color you enjoy and one that will work well with your car.  Want a green, but think BRG is overdone? Look at Aqua, Citron or even Limeflower. Want to stick to a classic white? Old English White, Snowberry and Glacier offer subtle differences to distinguish your car. Want to be the only one on your block? Try Black Tulip or Aconite. And of course, there are variations on the classics: eight shades of blue, five shades of dark green, and four shades of dark red.<p>\r\n<i> Click on the picture below for a larger view.</i>',19,1408,1,''),(125,13,'MG Midget/Austin-Healey Sprite','',9,1198,1,''),(126,13,'MGA Fasteners','On an MGA, there are 142 fasteners that are painted the same color as the rest of the body.

This MGB has a very special place in our hearts. It was crashed 15 months after it came off the line, and then was stored for the next 40 years. Paul bought this car in 2000, with the hope of restoring it to its former glory. As it had only 15,000 original miles, along with special details, such as inspection paint markings, factory original sound deadening material, and grease pencil markings, it was important that this car was restored to its original character, not modern standards. As such, the use of original parts was a must. This car suffered significant front end damage and required an entirely new grill. Paul scoured his extensive stock of original grilles for the perfect replacement. We’re hoping to make this MGB the perfect MGB, so a reproduction grille was out of the question. <p>\r\n\r\nWe’ve always known that reproduction grilles are substandard to originals. Reproductions—of all parts—tend to be inconsistent throughout the part, or fail to mimic the exact shape of the originals. This leads to an inadequate fit, and occasionally they’re so poorly made that they don’t fit at all. But as we searched for our best early grill, we noticed several differences between versions. Once we started actively started looking for these differences, we realized that there were many seemingly insignificant details that could differentiate not only originals from reproductions, but also originals from originals. <p>\r\nThus, we present for you, a study of MGB grilles, 1962-1969 (1970-1974 forthcoming).\r\n<i> Click the first picture to go through to the article.</i>',18,1392,1,''),(171,4,'MGA Mk II fender repair','This MK II MGA came to us with significant damage to the front right fender, as well as other damage to the right door and rear fender. But all hope was not lost!

The TR-250 combined the Michelotti-designed body of the TR4 with the overhauled chassis of the TR6 and a 2498 cc cylinder engine. With only 8,484 cars produced for the American market, this TR-250 is a rare example of a pivotal moment in Triumph\'s design history. The Surrey top, used only on the TR4 and 250, featured a rigid rear window and a removable middle section available in both hard and soft options. Both sections could be removed on sunny afternoons, but for those sensible drivers who didn\'t want to take their chances with England\'s fickle weather could keep the rigid rear section in place and store the soft top in the trunk for inevitable rain showers. <p>\r\n	In keeping with Sports Car Craftsmen\'s venerable tradition of supercharging cars at every available opportunity, we jumped at the chance to make this TR-250 the first car in the country to be supercharged with Moss Motor\'s latest conversion kit. Between the original overdrive and the supercharger, this singular piece of British automotive history is now a joy to drive, no matter the weather. ',14,1450,1,''),(175,5,'1977 MGB- The B your B can be like','MGBs may have been at the forefront of driving technology during their original run, but standards have changed in the intervening 40 years. The “Safety Fast!” motto now applied to these cars is a study in irony, given their lack of modern safety equipment and their frequent appearance on highway shoulders across the country. Unlike our other showroom cars, this 1977 MGB is stock in almost every respect — except under the hood. Using a few well-chosen modifications, it\'s possible to make an MGB vastly superior to the originals without sacrificing the character of the car. <p>\r\n	Our standard approach to modernization focuses on drivability. This MGB sports a  Nissan 5 speed conversion paired with a supercharger from Moss Motors. The result is a  lively, responsive ride. It can overtake semis or conquer mountain passes without breaking a sweat. The only limits are the fortitude of your backside and your tolerance for fun. <p>\r\n	MG experts will also notice that, despite its later model year, our MGB sports chrome bumpers, not the rubber bumpers introduced in late 1974. In our opinion, the styling of the original MGB greatly contributed to its iconic status. Replacing the original chrome bumpers recaptures so much of the character lost in later modifications.  We have also lowered the car an inch, which may sound inconsequential, but which dramatically improves the handling. \r\n	<p>Many people are skeptical of some of these big-ticket items, but a test drive highlights the bang you get for your buck. If you want to drive your car and actually enjoy the experience, updating it with a modern transmission and supercharger will bring you years of joy with your British car.

The trunk floor is a good example. The lip of the trunk, shaped as a channel to fit the trunk lid, also acts as a funnel for water, sending it straight into the trunk. The trunk itself is perfectly shaped to collect and store water as well as it stores picnic baskets. (If every house in Colorado had an MGA rainwater collection system, we’d no longer need drought restrictions.) If the car has carpet in the trunk, it absorbs water like a sponge, slowly releasing it to ensure maximum rust coverage. As a result, nearly every MGA restoration includes the replacement of the trunk floor. There are reproduction floors available, but we find these options to be inadequate in a number of ways. \r\n<p>\r\n<i> Click on the first picture to jump into the article!</i>\r\n',2,1472,1,''),(178,7,'1969 MBG- The B your B wants to...B.','This MGB is still owned by its original buyer, and we had the honor of restoring it in the winter of 2012.

',0,1482,1,''),(179,4,'MGA Sill Repair','British cars hold a reputation of being little more than fancy looking rust buckets on wheels. Admittedly, this characterization is not entirely unfair, especially in wetter climes. Here in Denver, however, we’re blessed with drier climate which gives British vintage cars a full, rich life before old age sets in. Our cars are known nationwide for their pristine and solid bodies, which are often spared from the ravages of time. (Paint choices such as “Golden Harvest” “Blaze” and “Limeflower”, on the other hand, betray their ancient heritage.)\r\nUnfortunately rust will eventually work its way into the panels of a car, no matter how dry the region. If rust is caught early, it’s usually confined to a few places and repairable. Rust repairs are a common job for us— whether as a stand-alone job or as part of a larger project. MGB dog legs, TR6 frame rails, and MGA sills are a few common problem areas where we regularly perform repairs. For MGA sill repairs, we’ve deemed the replacement sills available on the market inadequate. The time it takes to wrestle reproduction parts into a useable part isn’t worth the time or the change we feed into the swear box. Instead, we create each piece from scratch, which gives us total control over the part from start to finish.

Reproductions—of all parts—tend to be inconsistent width throughout the part, or fail to mimic the exact shape of the originals, leading to inadequate fit, and some times they’re so poorly made that they don’t fit at all. But as we searched for our best early grill, we noticed several differences between versions. Once we started actively started looking for these differences, we realized that there were many seemingly insignificant details that could differentiate not only originals from reproductions, but also originals from originals. \r\n\r\nThus, we present for you, a study of MGB grills, 1962-1969 (1970-1974 Forthcoming)\r\n','','','project',''),(871,168,'Paint by Era','<i>Click on the picture below for an even bigger view.
