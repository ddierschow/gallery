(739,45,'The Showroom ','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may feel transported into a different world once you step into our showroom, and to some extent, you are.  While it\'s packed with interesting bits and bobs to keep even the most avid fans occupied for hours, it also represents an entirely different way of thinking.  We readily admit that our showroom isn’t considered ‘normal’. Instead, we hope to show you just what British cars can do. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We highlight some of the newest innovations in British motoring, such as the supercharged Bugeye Sprite and Triumph TR250. Sports Car Craftsmen, LLC was the first shop in the country to install and test drive the supercharged Bugeye Sprite, which dramatically increases the horsepower of these cars, making them into street-legal go-carts. Triumph’s TR3, TR4, TR250 and TR6 now have the option of supercharging as well, to make sure that fun is equally shared among all British car marques.<br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nissan 5 speed conversion is another upgrade we like to promote as a way to get the most from your MG. It’s important to have an overdriven top gear for prolonged highway driving, and this modern option is less expensive to install and easier to find than the factory original overdrive transmissions. With this upgrade, motoring in the beautiful Colorado mountains becomes easier and more enjoyable. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cosmetic department, we feature an MGB bumper conversion from rubber to chrome, a worthwhile undertaking for those who prefer the chrome bumpers on their later model MGBs. All of our showroom cars are available for a demonstration ride by appointment. At Sports Car Craftsmen we believe in showing you how fun your British car can be and will gladly answer any questions you may have. A restoration, whether partial or an entire renovation, a transmission conversion or engine rebuild can be a daunting proposition. We will walk you through the process, making it an easy and painless transition. And at the end of the journey, you should be happy with the increased performance and drivability of your new car. Many of us owned British cars as younger, and perhaps less sensible folks who believed that driving these cars was exciting, exotic, and adventurous. Today, you might recall your faded youth with a car that actually lives up to those expectations. And with your improved performance, it’s easier than ever to hook kids and grandkids, ensuring another generation of British car enthusiasts. <br></br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a large selection of literature covering the cost of paint jobs and engine rebuilds, as well as advice on worthwhile modern upgrades for your car and factory information about our supercharging kits.  We also showcase a vast collection of British sports car memorabilia, from posters to model cars and trophies. Every shop has its obligatory cache of cool stuff, and ours is second to none.  You can see pictures of some of our most exciting restorations and read up on the latest British sports car events happening around Colorado. \r\n','Paul Dierschow','P9120006.JPG',2,1,''),

On the later K6, the middle section of windows is much larger than the two columns of side windows, and the whole box is a foot shorter.  This phone box once resided in Connecticut and during a recent visit to the annual British Motor Trade Association conference in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Paul decided it was only a short jaunt over to Connecticut to acquire and retrieve this prize.

(915,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that many hundreds of cars will be driving toward Colorado this June for MG 2009 in Breckenridge. We hope that this trip is a memorable one for the attendees, albeit hopefully for the right reasons, not wrong ones.  Undoubtedly, we\'ll be called on to help coach people through the mechanical aspects of making the trip successfully, so here\'s some tips about what you might expect to encounter on your adventure.<br></br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that most people will notice about the time they arrive at the folksy Colorado border sign is a distinctly lower level of performance than they are accustomed to from their car.  This is a very common complaint; that\'s because it affects everyone unilaterally.  There\'s an easy explanation, and it\'s found under your hood.  If you open it and look, you\'ll find that . . . someone stole your compression!!!  Yep, while you were minding your own business during the mind-numbing drive across Nebraska, Kansas, or Texas, you wuz robbed.  Even though your eyes were open, your air density was decreased by a full 10%, and you may have even missed the posted warning signs entirely.  As if that wasn\'t bad enough, you\'ll find that the consequence of that invisible, meager 10% decrease in air pressure translates into a whopping 18% loss of horsepower.  So your perky MG with 135 psi compression at home can now only muster about 120 psi in Denver at 5300 feet.  And that\'s just at the base of the Big Hill.  Sixty miles further west, by the time you cross under the Continental Divide inside the Eisenhower tunnels on I-70, you\'ll exceed 11,000 feet. Ay, caramba!  Now we\'re talking only double digit compression, and horsepower that won\'t qualify as a moron!  If you don\'t believe it\'s important, just get out of your car at the tunnel parking lot and test it for yourself by running a short sprint. You\'ll have new sympathy for your car.  (Just kidding, DON\'T DO IT!  You\'ll be flattened. Now.)<br></br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what\'s the solution?  The easy answer is to replace your lost compression with that produced by a supercharger.  End of that problem.  However, the answer for the rest of us is basically, to live with it, with some minor adjustments.  The most important adjustment is to one\'s expectations.  Climbing the Big Hill requires patience and perhaps some strategizing, but you\'ll never get your performance back until you head back toward home.  As far as tuning for altitude, these are closely guarded secrets which have been passed down through incestuous generations of grizzled British car mechanics, akin to those of voodoo magic.  But now, for the first time ever, under threat of excommunication from Brotherhood of Keepers of Anachronistic Transport Contraptions, I will reveal the secret.  Here\'s the magic formula, never before seen in print . . . . LEAN OUT THE MIXTURE!  That\'s it.  That\'s all there is.<br></br>\r\n<i> Continued on the next page...</i>','Timothy Winkel','scan00011.jpg',0,1,'Would you like to take your British car to this altitude? Find out how!'),
(916,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sort of a let down, huh?  The principle involved is this: as you drive higher, your fuel supply through the carb remains the same, even though the air component of the mixture keeps getting less and less.  This results in a mixture that continues to get richer as the air gets thinner, and before you know it you\'ve got some serious drivability problems.  Like smoking that rivals anything Detroit Diesel can produce.  The fix is to simply reduce the amount of fuel to return the air/fuel mixture to normal.  With a typical SU installation, the adjustment is simple: we plan on about a two flat adjustment of the jet adjusting nuts to make the mixture right for Denver; prorate for going higher.  That translates to 10 flats down from having the jet flush with the bridge, instead of 12 at sea level.  While the final tuning must always be done on the exhaust gas analyzer, this rule of thumb is good enough to get a car running from scratch.  We are frequently asked about the use of lean metering needles in our area, and we find that they are not necessary IF (hugely important if) the jets are in good condition.  With SU carbs, we do not consider using a lean needle unless a customer drives their car mostly above 8000 feet.  Stromberg cars are another story; we usually prefer lean needles, but mainly for the purposes of passing emissions testing.  Weber conversions require jet changes - that\'s a whole different article.\r\n<br></br>\r\n<i> Continued on the next page...</i>','Paul Dierschow','PB061161.JPG',1,1,'Page 2'),
(917,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further adjustment that can be made, perhaps for the skeptics who might believe there\'s got to be more to it than just a simple mixture adjustment (trust me, you\'re not going to get your performance back...).  A small consolation prize can be won by advancing the timing just a little bit; 2 or 3 degrees is about it.  The principle involved here is that engines produce more power the more advanced the timing is, but too much advance will be harmful, as the engine will detonate (ping), and that burns holes in piston crowns (rarely considered desirable).  However, with your compression having been involuntarily lowered, you can advance the timing a little bit without incurring detonation, and therefore produce marginally more power.  I almost hate to mention this, as timing advance should be regarded as a loaded weapon, and handled in an educated and measured fashion.  If a little advance is good, more is not necessarily better!  <br></br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole tuning for altitude discussion is really greatly overshadowed by a much larger issue; one that we have to deal with nearly every day in the shop.  That is that carb adjustments are often the least of a car\'s woes.  More often than not, drivability complaints are explained by problems other than carb issues, instead they are almost always ignition related.  When a customer brings in a car complaining of carb problems, the first place we look is at the ignition system.  That\'s because the symptoms involved are often misleading; carb and ignition problems can manifest themselves similarly.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that 90% of \"carb\" problems are found under the distributor cap.  If someone complains that the carbs won\'t hold their tune for more than a week, the problem is most likely not carburettor related.  The bottom line is don\'t touch the carbs until the entire ignition system is proven to be good.  And the best tuning won\'t do much good if the basic condition of the engine is not sound.  You must start with good basics first.<br></br>\r\n<i> Continued on the next page...</i>','','PB061160.JPG',2,1,'Page 3'),
(918,71,'','&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here\'s some tips to increase your odds of making a successful trip:<br></br>\r\n• Check out your car thoroughly before you leave - do not wing it and hope for the best (this actually does happen).  Book your appointment now with your local LBC shop to be sure your car is up for the journey.<br></br>\r\n• Avoid using fuel containing ethanol, especially in high temperatures.  Our lower atmospheric pressure causes the fuel to vaporize easier, which induces vapor lock. The higher you go, the worse it gets.<br></br>\r\n• Pressure test your cooling system, as the ability to maintain high pressures is the key to not overheating.  Water boils at much lower temperatures out here: 202 at Denver, 192 at 11,000 feet.  Also, remember that running hot (good) does not equate to overheating (bad).<br></br>\r\n• If you encounter drivability problems along the way, don\'t start by fooling with the carbs - most likely it\'s explained by something else.<br></br>\r\n• If something untoward does happen, don\'t fret - you\'ve got the world\'s best classic car support system at your disposal.  You\'ve got highly qualified technicians available at the other end of the phone and you\'ve got whatever part you might possibly need only a day away, thanks to the wonders of air freight, and suppliers who really do care about the well being of their customers.  You\'re also in the company of a great crowd of caring enthusiasts with similar interests who never fail to amaze me with their stories of generosity and support for their comrades.<br></br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you the very best of luck on your journey.

(1092,101,'Tips 1 & 2','<br></br>\r\n\r\n1. With the engine off, push and release the clutch pedal.  Then, with a pry bar pushing between the crankshaft damper and the nearby crossmember, push the crankshaft backward in the block.  The backward movement should ideally be .004 to .008 inch; barely noticeable.  Upwards of .030 inch is common, but savable with immediate attention.  .125 inch indicates that the engine is a goner, most likely fatally damaging both crank and block.  $$$$$\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n2.  Look under the car sideways from the front edge of the driver\'s door and notice the angle of the clutch release arm sticking downward from the left side of the bellhousing.  If the arm points straight down, all is well; if it points back from vertical, the bolt that holds the clutch release bearing fork to the cross-shaft has sheared, requiring a transmission removal for repair.  $$$\r\n\r\n','','P2010064.JPG',0,1,''),
(1093,101,'Tips 3 & 4','<br></br>\r\n3.  With the engine running and foot very firmly on the brake, slowly release the clutch while not allowing the car to move.  Then shift into reverse and repeat.  You are listening for a sharp clunk from the differential which reveals that the right front differential mount stud has broken loose from its woefully under-designed frame attachment.  All cars will need this repair at one time or another and requires differential removal for a proper repair.  $$\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n4.  With the hood open, look straight downward at each side of the front of the engine and observe the steel box welded to the frame where the lower control arms mount.  The box should be perfectly square and solid to the frame, and are frequently injured, particularly at the right rear mounting.  Look at the number of shims behind each control arm bracket: more than 5 or less than 1 on any one of the four insists on further examination.  $$\r\n\r\n','','P5261363.JPG',1,1,''),
(1094,101,'Tips 5 & 6','<br></br>\r\n5.  Look at the chassis member on which each rear control arm mounts.  These are very frequently rusted out and may be indicators of more insidious chassis rust.  $$$\r\n<br></br>\r\n6. Grab the top of the rear tires and try to vigorously shake the wheel sideways.  Clunking here may indicate loose wheel bearings which could reveal severely worn rear axle parts. $$\r\n<br></br>\r\n','','PA310041.JPG',2,1,''),
(1095,101,'Tips 7 & 8','7.  Look carefully at the seams between the body panels.  The four fenders should join their related scuttle, tonneau and front and rear panels with a clean, seamsealed groove.   The fenders should join the rocker panels below the chrome strip in a perfectly flush fashion, with the rear fender attached to the rocker with a small dot of brazing to enforce that flushness.  The joint lines frequently disappear with shoddy rust repair methods.  $$$$-???\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n8.  From the front of the car, sight down the gap between the hood and fender, and continue sighting that line down the top of the door and down the rear fender joint.  This line should reveal a gentle, consistent bulge in the middle with each side being a perfect mirror image of the other.  A lack of uniformity reveals some sort of serious incident in the car\'s past, which also demands further investigation.  Inspect the upper fender swage line.  The width should be uniform down the entire length of the car, tapering to zero at the end of each fender.  Lack of uniformity only belies bad bodywork, but it may be an indicator of what lies underneath.  $$-???\r\n<br></br>\r\n\r\n','','PA310043.JPG',3,1,''),
(1096,101,'Tips 9 & 10','9.  Inspect the corners of the fenders; TR6 have numerous build in rust traps that, if revealed on the outer panels, most likely indicate similar damage to the related inner panels.  Look in the pockets above and around the headlamps and below the chrome line at the rear of the front fenders.  The rear fenders are particularly vulnerable above the tail lamps and along the edges at the top and front of those panels.  $$-??\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n10.  With the car on the ground, notice the gaps at the front and back of the doors relative to the adjacent fenders.  The front gap should have a consistent width; the rear almost never does with an original frame.  If that rear gap is twice as wide at the top as the bottom, it\'s normal and only visual annoying.  If the top gap is triple the lower width, the car\'s mileage is most likely well into six digits, regardless of what the odometer says.  $$-??\r\n<br></br>\r\n','','P5290175.JPG',4,1,''),
(1097,101,'','Realizing that driving our LBCs is a highly tactile experience, we like to pay close attention to small details of car repair that contribute to the sensory inputs experienced by the driver.  Some of these are major (i.e. switchgear operation, instrumentation, heater and door mechanisms). Others are much more subtle (ripples on the top of the hood, windshields with optical distortion, loose or rattling mirrors).\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\nHere are three things we frequently deal with on TR6s that offer a very good return on investment toward making them far more enjoyable to drive.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n1.  Fix the looseness in the accelerator linkage.  Replacing the bushings which mount the pedal cross-shaft in the firewall and replacing the worn bolt and pivoting plate between the carbs will eliminate the lost motion in the system, which contributes greatly to the driver\'s perception of throttle precision.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n2.  Fix the looseness in the steering system.  These cars are notorious for allowing the entire rack and pinion to shift side-to-side in its mounting brackets on the frame.  Although new U-bolts and polyurethane bushings are a great improvement, simply spreading the brackets per the factory manual will usually do it.  Also, the little shelf just inside the firewall on which the upper steering column mounts is frequently broken at its corners.  A very minor welding job will work wonders to firm up the steering.\r\n\r\n<br></br>\r\n3.  Replace the driver\'s seat diaphragm to solve that sinking feeling.  We know where old yellow pages go in retirement, but this is a far better, inexpensive solution.  Sitting back in the proper driving position can give one a whole new outlook on life.\r\n\r\n','','P5261361.JPG',5,1,''),

(15,3,'Shop Move','&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since our inception in 1998, Sports Car Craftsmen has steadily increased  our customer base at least ten fold. As of July 2006, our shop had long outgrown our building, spreading over three unattached units. Clearly, this was not an ideal way to do business. Thus, when the right building came along, Paul jumped at the chance to consolidate all our operations to one location. Located in Arvada, Colorado, not five minutes from the old shop and with a large lot to accommodate storage building expansion, the previous site of Arvada Auto Body was an excellent fit. However, there was no way we could have moved all our inventory, cars, tools, and unidentified stuff by ourselves, even if the new location were just across the street. With this in mind, we called upon the most gullible people we knew—our families. After four of them showed up, we realized we would have to look else where for willing help. And right in front of our noses was a veritable army of people ready to share their time, packing skills, cars, trucks, trailers, and anything else that would be useful when moving—our customers. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we could move into the new shop, we altered it a bit, creating a showroom in the front third of the building, a parts department in one of the work areas, and installing pallet rack on every available wall. Additionally, we graded and surfaced the storage lot to make it the perfect location for a dozen shipping containers, each of which conveniently hold eight of our British cars. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the weekend of July 22nd-23rd, 2006, we assembled the masses and tore apart the shop, piece by piece, car by car, and completely emptied the property in three days. Slowly (and kicking up enough dust to cause a mini ice-age), we shifted our shop two miles away. With Paul directing the show at one end, Ted on the forklift, Brad at the other end, the rest of the gang moving in between with a big old truck named Lulu, we successfully moved 94 cars, three hydraulic lifts, a mill, a lathe, three sandblasters, endless equipment, and our entire parts department. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from our customers. We never expected the amazing turnout we had that weekend of movers and shakers who wanted to keep going long after we had tired. Even after the weekend had ended and the main event was over, we still had customers stopping by to help with the clean up.  And in the time it took us to shake off the dust and put everything to rights, our customers patiently waited for our doors to open for regular business once again. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To show our appreciation for all our great customers, we had grand re-opening Open House in September to show off our new digs. Free food and drinks, along with the opportunity to examine the new shop top to bottom brought the crowds flocking in and an enjoyable time was had by all. <br></br>\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though that moved was a few years ago, we are still indebted to those who gave their time to help us out.

The thoroughness of the engineering of this kit is exceptional, right down to the use of the original Triumph shift lever.  However, it\'s the first on-ramp merge that will convince most people of the quality of this kit, not to mention the satisfaction enjoyed in the following years of use.

(93,5,'What Does a Paint Job Cost?','That’s a question we are asked frequently, but has no quick or easy answer. It’s similar to asking what it costs to build a house. There’s an enormous range of conditions, specifications, and circumstances that can easily make one job ten times more expensive than another. A close examination of the specifics of your car allows us to give a realistic cost estimate. Some of the factors to consider are:\r\n<br></br> •	Rust Repair — does it need new repairs or corrections to old work?\r\n<br></br> •	Collision repairs — does it have fresh damage orneed  corrections to old work?\r\n<br></br> •	Stripping the body — does it need media blasting, hand sanding, or scuffing only?\r\n<br></br> •	Removal and replacement of trim parts — this requires a huge about of time when done properly\r\n<br></br> •	The actual paint job — assumes body is prepped as above and ready for paint\r\n<br></br> •	Paint and materials cost — includes a long list of supplies and there\'s a wide range of qualities\r\n<br></br> •	Associated parts used for refinishing — new rubber, chrome, trim, fasteners, and a lengthy list of fiddly bits. \r\n<br></br> \r\nObviously, a paint job is much more than just applying paint to the car. Most of the cost of the job involves work and items that aren’t apparent to the untrained eye. Back to the house analogy, a great paint job begins with a strong foundation. A great paint job is wasted if not applied to a solid substrate. “Quick and dirty” paint jobs that don’t address and correct the underlying problems are short term patches that always disappoint. \r\n<br></br> \r\nThis list demonstrates that the cost of a complete, competent paint job can be significant. Ultimately, it is the customer that must determine what the budget will and will not allow. The answer to the cost question essentially boils down to the answer for another question: How much time do you want us to lavish on your car?  As with most things in life, you generally get what you pay for. \r\n<br></br> \r\nWe are aware that many customers will experience sticker shock when discussing these issues but after comparison shopping, it’s always obvious that we offer exceptional value for the high quality of work we do. \r\n<br></br> \r\nSports Car Craftsmen has expert knowledge about every aspect of your classic car.

To date, the honor roll of alumni is well past 3000 cars, many of which I would like to have back.  But as they say, hindsight is always 20-20, and one must remember that business decisions are always determined by the economics of the time.  What\'s past is past.\r\n<br></br>\r\nRecently, it was time to face dealing with an seriously ailing \'66 MGB roadster.  It was one of those difficult end of life decisions.  Yes, it could have kept on going with all the right treatments and circumstances, but honestly, there was no quality of life left whatsoever, so it was time to let go and harvest the organs.  A portion of the left rear quarter went immediately--before the body was even cold--to help finish a wonderful \'67 GT that is currently being painted as we speak.  It was the last piece needed to make the renovation of this one-owner car complete, and thus allowed another car to survive gloriously into its second half-century.  The steel wheel suspension allowed an aspiring racer to rid itself of its infernal wire wheels.  The scuttle will help complete another steel dash retrofit into an unfortunately built pillow dash model.  All are noble causes now advanced by another\'s selfless sacrifice.\r\n<br></br>\r\nRegrettably, what finally did the \'66 in, of course, was all-to-common terminal cancer.  As with so many of these cases, there had been previous occurrences, but remission was only a temporary reprieve, as we\'ve seen so many times before.  The respite was undoubtedly appreciated, as it allowed a few more years of somewhat compromised enjoyment, but everyone likely knew in unspoken agreement that the inevitable would come, probably sooner than later.  Surely, things had deteriorated to a state of only existing, but not <i>living</i>.\r\n<br></br>\r\nPart of the previous treatment included dealing with the floors, which had been severely compromised by some risky lifestyle choices in its past.  I\'m sure we\'ve all seen this many times, but the normal solution is to \"patch\" the dying panel with whatever is lying around handy.  Traffic signs seem to be the favorite by far, probably due to their ubiquity, sturdy gauge, and inexpensive means of acquisition, but lesser quality repairs have included plywood sheets, new floorpans laid on top of the original, old license plates, or simply glued down indoor-outdoor carpet.  The solution used in the subject \'66 was amazing beyond all previous cases: poured concrete!  Nicely floated and troweled to a smooth surface, although not quite leveled, which resulted in somewhat of a tilt, with about 2\" thickness in the front, down to 1\" in the rear.  Unfortunately, this technique rendered the seat bottoms unsalvageable (not to mention unadjustable), as they were cast right in to the floor mass, along with everything else that was in the way.\r\n<br></br>\r\nAt first, this novel approach might sound crude, or at least unrefined, but upon further consideration it now seems to be nothing short of brilliant.  Think of the benefits: unexcelled sound deadening and vibration damping; unbeatable washability and wear resistance; and an impressive lowering of the CG.  Probably the biggest benefit would be that it provides the solution to the problem that American MG owners would appreciate the most: finally, adequate heat insulation from the under-seat muffler found on most of our cars.  As one of my past employees suggested, the placement of exhausts under the left side floorboard was a very deliberate choice by the Brits as their revenge for losing the war to us some years back.  I\'ll also get the last laugh with this car; at over $200 per ton, scrapping this car will provide a nice little bonus beyond the norm!\r\n<br></br>\r\nI am a firm believer in the myriad benefits offered by this discussion board, especially when it exposes us old dogs to new techniques brought to the industry through technological advances.  I hope these discoveries will open the eyes and minds of some traditionalists who might otherwise be unaware of modern alternatives to conventional old-school methods.',41,NULL,0,''),

Between our vast collection of original parts, our library of original shop and parts manuals, dozens of reference texts, and our years of experience, we can reconstruct the evolution of these cars over their lifespan. \r\nThis August, we were on a quest to replace the grill on a very special 1964 MGB. This MGB has a very special place in our hearts. It was crashed 15 months after it came off the line, and then was stored for the next 40 years. Paul bought this car in 2000, with the hope of restoring it to its former glory. As it had only 15,000 original miles, along with special details, such as inspection paint markings, factory original sound deadening material, and grease pencil markings, it was important that this car was restored to its original character, not to modern standards. As such, the use of original parts was a must. This car suffered significant front end damage, and required an entirely new grill. Paul scoured his extensive stock of original grills for the perfect replacement. We’re hoping to make this MGB the perfect MGB, so a reproduction grill was out of the question. \r\nWe’ve always known that reproduction grills are substandard to originals. Reproductions—of all parts—tend to be inconsistent width throughout the part, or fail to mimic the exact shape of the originals, leading to inadequate fit, and some times they’re so poorly made that they don’t fit at all. But as we searched for our best early grill, we noticed several differences between versions. Once we started actively started looking for these differences, we realized that there were many seemingly insignificant details that could differentiate not only originals from reproductions, but also originals from originals. \r\n\r\nThus, we present for you, a study of MGB grills, 1962-1969 (1970-1974 Forthcoming)\r\n',67,NULL,0,''),
